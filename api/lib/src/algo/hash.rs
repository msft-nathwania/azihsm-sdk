//! Cryptographic hash algorithm implementations.
//!
//! This module provides HSM-compatible hash algorithms including SHA-1, SHA-256,
//! SHA-384, and SHA-512. It supports both single-shot and streaming hash operations
//! through traits defined in the parent module.
//!
//! # Supported Algorithms
//!
//! - **SHA-1**: 160-bit hash (deprecated for cryptographic use)
//! - **SHA-256**: 256-bit hash from the SHA-2 family
//! - **SHA-384**: 384-bit hash from the SHA-2 family
//! - **SHA-512**: 512-bit hash from the SHA-2 family
//!
//! # Operation Modes
//!
//! The module provides two operation modes:
//!
//! ## Single-shot Operations
//!
//! Complete hash computation in a single call, suitable for data
//! that fits in memory. This mode is optimal for small to medium-sized
//! data where all input is available at once.
//!
//! ## Streaming Operations
//!
//! Incremental hash computation through multiple update calls,
//! suitable for large data or streaming sources. This mode enables
//! memory-efficient processing of data that doesn't fit in memory
//! or arrives over time.
//!
//! # Platform Integration
//!
//! Hash operations delegate to platform-specific cryptographic libraries:
//! - Linux: OpenSSL implementations with hardware acceleration
//! - Windows: CNG (Cryptography Next Generation) APIs
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! Hash algorithm instances are safe to clone and use across threads.
//! However, individual hash contexts are not thread-safe and should
//! be used from a single thread.

/// Enumeration of supported hash algorithms.
///
/// This enum represents the hash algorithms supported by the HSM,
/// providing compile-time type safety for algorithm selection. Each
/// variant corresponds to a specific SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)
/// implementation with different output sizes and security properties.
///
/// # Algorithm Properties
///
/// | Algorithm | Output Size | Block Size | Security Level |
/// |-----------|-------------|------------|----------------|
/// | SHA-1     | 160 bits    | 512 bits   | Broken         |
/// | SHA-256   | 256 bits    | 512 bits   | 128 bits       |
/// | SHA-384   | 384 bits    | 1024 bits  | 192 bits       |
/// | SHA-512   | 512 bits    | 1024 bits  | 256 bits       |
///
/// # Security Considerations
///
/// - **SHA-1**: Cryptographically broken due to collision attacks. Use only
///   for non-security purposes like checksums or legacy system compatibility.
/// - **SHA-256**: Provides adequate security for most applications. Widely
///   supported and efficient.
/// - **SHA-384**: Truncated SHA-512 variant offering higher security margin.
/// - **SHA-512**: Provides the highest security level and is recommended for
///   applications requiring long-term cryptographic strength.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Performance varies by algorithm and platform:
/// - SHA-256 is generally fastest on 32-bit architectures
/// - SHA-512 is often faster on 64-bit architectures
/// - Hardware acceleration (AES-NI, SHA extensions) significantly improves performance
