/// ECC digital signature algorithm implementation using raw elliptic curve operations.
///
/// This type provides HSM-backed ECC signature and verification operations supporting
/// various elliptic curves (P-256, P-384, P-521). Unlike full ECDSA implementations,
/// this operates on pre-computed hashes provided by the caller, allowing flexible
/// hash algorithm selection and support for custom message preparation.
///
/// The caller is responsible for:
/// - Hashing the message data using an appropriate hash algorithm
/// - Ensuring the hash size matches the curve requirements
/// - Managing any required padding or message encoding
///
/// ECC signatures provide:
/// - Strong security with smaller key sizes compared to RSA
/// - Probabilistic signatures (each signature includes fresh randomness)
/// - Non-deterministic behavior unless using RFC 6979 deterministic ECDSA
///
/// # Supported Operations
///
/// - [`SignOp`]: Single-shot signature generation over pre-computed hash
/// - [`SignStreamingOp`]: Streaming signature generation for incremental hash computation
/// - [`VerifyOp`]: Single-shot signature verification over pre-computed hash
/// - [`VerifyStreamingOp`]: Streaming signature verification for incremental hash computation
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// The algorithm delegates to the HSM's underlying cryptographic provider, which may
/// be hardware-accelerated. Key material never leaves the HSM's secure boundary.
